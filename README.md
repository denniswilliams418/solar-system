# solar-system
Animated computer rendering of the solar system (work in progress)

Backend is finished.  Add in front end portion for actual rendering.

Some files (like Angel-yjc.h) are referenced code from an Interactive Computer Graphics course I took â€“ they cover initialization methods such as setting up the shaders as well as providing some added functionality for 3D programming.
